<h1>Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project aims to implement image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python with the help of TensorFlow. The project utilizes the CIFAR10 dataset, which is a popular benchmark dataset in the field of image classification. The CNN Sequential model is used as the model architecture, involving the stacking of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to achieve high accuracy in image classification.</p>
<p>In addition, various libraries are used, including tensorflow.keras.models, tensorflow.keras.layers, tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image, numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn. The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the pixel values and performing data augmentation to increase the robustness of the model. After training, evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the performance of the model. Finally, the project uses visualization techniques such as confusion matrix and classification report to interpret the results and improve the model's performance.</p>

<h2>Overview of Project Design</h2>

<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>The first step in the project design is data preprocessing. It includes reading the dataset using Python's built-in libraries, understanding the data format and performing operations like normalization. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable form for the deep learning model to process.</p>

<h3>Model Design</h3>
<p>In the second step, we design the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Artificial neural Network (ANN) model using the Keras library. The CNN model is designed with multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers. The number of layers and their parameters are chosen based on the complexity of the dataset and the desired accuracy.</p>

<h2>Model Compilation</h2>
<p>After designing the CNN model, the next step is to compile it using the Keras library. During the compilation process, the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric are defined. The optimizer is used to update the weights of the neural network, the loss function is used to measure the performance of the model, and the evaluation metric is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model.</p>

<h2>Model Training</h2>
<p>In this step, we train the CNN as well as ANN model using the CIFAR10 dataset. The training process involves passing the data through the model, updating the weights using the optimizer, and measuring the performance using the loss function. The training process continues for several epochs until the model reaches the desired level of accuracy.</p>

<h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
<p>Once the model is trained, the next step is to evaluate its performance using the test dataset. We use the evaluation metric defined during model compilation to measure the accuracy of the model. We also use other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's performance.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, the project's design includes data preprocessing, model design, compilation, training, evaluation, optimization, and deployment. By following this design, we can build a robust and accurate image classification model using CNN with the CIFAR10 dataset.</p>
